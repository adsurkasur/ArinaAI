## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Git**
- **Virtual Environment** (`venv`)
- **[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)** (for AI models)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/adsurkasur/ArinaAI.git
   cd ArinaAI
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note:** Some dependencies may not be directly downloadable from PyPI. They might require specific installation links from the project's GitHub or modifications for hardware compatibility.

4. **Install an AI Model Using Ollama:**  
   Arina requires a compatible AI model. Use Ollama to install a suitable model:

   ```sh
   ollama pull gemma2  # You can replace 'gemma2' with any compatible AI model
   ```

5. **Run Arina AI:**

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Running the Web UI

To access the Arina Web UI:

1. **Start the Backend:** Run the `main.py` script in the backend directory.

   ```sh
   python backend/main.py
   ```

2. **Open the Web UI:**

   - Navigate to the `arina-ui/public/index.html` file.
   - Open it in a browser manually or use a local web server.

   Example using Python's built-in server:

   ```sh
   cd arina-ui/public
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

   **Note:** A major UI revamp is in progress using Figma to enhance design and interactivity.

## Usage

- **Start Chatting:** Once Arina is running, you can interact via the web interface or terminal.
- **Give Feedback:** Arina improves over time based on your interactions and feedback.
- **Customize Models:** You can experiment with different AI models using Ollama.
