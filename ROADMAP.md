# Arina AI Roadmap

This document outlines the development phases for Arina AI, focusing on enhancing its capabilities step by step. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a structured and scalable approach.

## Phase 0: Current State
- **Core Functionality**: FastAPI-based backend with Ollama for AI responses.
- **Memory System**: SQLite database with Sentence-Transformers for long-term memory.
- **Model Used**: Gemma 2 for response generation _(subject to change as development progresses)_.
- **Search Capability**: DuckDuckGo integration for external knowledge retrieval _(may be updated in future iterations)_.
- **Time Awareness**: Recognizes time gaps and user activity patterns.
- **Language Adaptation**: Learns and adjusts to the userâ€™s preferred language over time.

## Phase 1: Enhancing AI Contextual Awareness
- **Improve Memory Context Handling**: Ensure memory retrieval aligns with the current conversation.
- **Optimize Search Integration**: Smarter fallback when knowledge is unavailable.
- **Advanced Time Awareness**: Detect trends in user interactions.
- **Better Response Structuring**: Improve how Arina forms and organizes responses.

## Phase 2: Business Feasibility Analysis
- **Investment & Cost Analysis**: ROI, BEP, operational cost calculations.
- **User Data Input Handling**: Accept structured financial data for feasibility studies.
- **Export Feature**: Generate CSV/Excel reports for business analysis.
- **Live Graph & Chart Integration**: Real-time visualization for financial projections and analysis.

## Phase 3: POM-QM Decision Support with Operations Research Features
- **Operations Research & Decision-Making Tools**: Implement POM-QM-based quantitative methods.
- **Live Graph & Chart Integration**: Ensure real-time updates for forecasting, optimization, and scheduling.
- **Interactive Forecasting**: Allow users to extend projections dynamically without re-entering data.
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Enable smooth and responsive data adjustments for better decision-making.

## Phase 4 (UNDER REVIEW): Agriculture AI & Industry-Specific AI Models
- **AI Model Specialization**: Each industry (Agriculture, Manufacturing, etc.) will have its own fine-tuned AI model.
- **Reevaluating Focus**: Originally focused on agriculture, now expanding to multiple industries.
- **Pending Research**: Further analysis required to determine feasibility and scope of industry-specific AI solutions.

## Phase 5: UI/UX Enhancements & Frontend Integration
- **Dynamic Tables**: Allow users to input structured data for calculations.
- **Smoother Interactions**: Implement animations and UI refinements.
- **Better Chat Interface**: More intuitive and visually appealing frontend.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure Arina is user-friendly across devices.

## Phase 6: Making the Server Online for Global Access
- **Deployment Strategy**: Set up a hosting solution for Arina's backend.
- **API Accessibility**: Make endpoints available for external access.
- **Scalability Planning**: Ensure the system can handle multiple users efficiently.
- **Security Measures**: Implement authentication and secure communication protocols.

## Exploratory Phase: Blockchain Integration & Utility Token Implementation
- **Utility Token System**: Introduce a token for accessing premium AI features.
- **Token-Based Incentives**: Reward users for feedback, bug reports, and valuable contributions.
- **Decentralized Transactions**: Enable token usage for AI-driven reports, insights, and transactions.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Ensure transparent and automated processing of AI-related transactions.

## Continuous Improvement & Expansion
- **User Feedback Integration**: Allow users to suggest improvements dynamically.
- **Advanced Memory Refinements**: Enhance memory retention and recall efficiency.
- **Further AI Model Optimizations**: Explore new models for improved performance.
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: Consider additional AI-driven tools or features.

**Note:**  
- The AI model used (currently Gemma 2) may change as development progresses to improve performance and adaptability.  
- The search capability (currently using DuckDuckGo) may be replaced or enhanced with other search integrations in future updates.
- Each phase will include iterative UI/UX enhancements as new features are added.
